Notes from "Learn Vimscript the Hard Way" (Steve Losh)

# Echoing messages
:echo "string" # echoes string to the bottom of vim window
:echom "string" # same but also logs to :messages

# Setting options

:set booleanoption and set nobooleanoption set options on and off.
:set booleanoption! toggles booleanoption.
:set option? queries state of booleanoption.

:set valueoption=integer
:set valueoption?


# Leaders
:nnoremap <buffer> <leader>x dd
# Local leader
The local leader is a second leader key, a prefix
for mappings that take effect for certain types of files
e.g. python or html.
let maplocalleader = "\\" #sets to \ . Could also use '\'
#
# Disabling keys
# E.g.
:inoremap <esc> <nop>
#
# Buffer-local options 
:setlocal nowrap # Set option for current buffer only
# Buffer-local mappings
# E.g. dd map for active buffer
:nnoremap <buffer> <leader>x dd
# The following is preferred in plugins to avoid conflicts
# with a user's leader mappings.
:nnoremap <buffer> <localleader>x dd
# where a buffer-local mapping and global mapping share
# the same key, vim gives precedence to the buffer-local one.
#
# Autocommands
:autocmd BufWritePre,BufRead *.html :normal gg=G # Re-indent any html file on reading and before writing.
:autocmd BufNewFile,BufRead *.html setlocal nowrap
:autocmd FileType python    nnoremap <buffer> <localleader>c I#<Esc>

print foo(bar }}})
